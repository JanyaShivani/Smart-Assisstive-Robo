Smart Assistive Robo for Elderly 

This robot is designed to come to the elderly person when a help button is pressed.
A push button is given to the user (bedside or wearable). When the button is pressed, the robot starts moving and navigates towards the user’s location to provide assistance such as carrying small items, medicines, or alerting a caretaker.

The system uses:
A microcontroller (ESP32) to control the robot.

DC motors with motor driver for movement.

An ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles while moving.

This helps elderly people to easily call a nearby assistive robot without using a phone or voice.

In Wokwi, the ESP32, push button, motor driver and ultrasonic sensor are connected virtually.
When the push button is pressed in the simulation, the motors are activated and the robot logic starts.
By changing the distance value of the ultrasonic sensor in Wokwi, obstacle detection and movement behaviour can be tested.
